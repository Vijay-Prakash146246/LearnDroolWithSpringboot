The Drools is an open-source business rule management system that can be integrated easily 
with the spring boot application.

The KIE project supports the integration of the drools with other technologies like the 
spring boot framework.

Configure the drools application
---------------------------------
The configuration class defines a spring bean KieContainer. The KieContainer is used to build 
the rule engine by loading the rule files under the application’s /resources folder.

We create the KieFileSystem instance and configure the rule engine and load the DRL file from 
the application’s resources directory.

Also, we can use the KieBuilder instance to build the drools module. We can use the KieSerive 
singleton instance to create the KieBuilder instance.

Finally, we use KieService to create a KieContainer and configure it as a spring bean

Add the model classes
----------------------
Create a Pojo class with the name OrderRequest

Define the drools rules
------------------------
Create the drools rules inside a file with extension .drl inside resources.
We need to import the models that are being used in the DRL file.
Each rule can be described with a description using the rule keyword.
We can use when-then syntax to define the conditions for a rule.

------------------------
We are injecting the KieContainer instance and creating a KieSession instance.
To pass the request object to the DRL file, we can use the insert() method.
Then we fire all the rules by calling the fireAllRules() method.
Finally terminate the session by calling the dispose() method of the KieSession.
